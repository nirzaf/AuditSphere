# T006 — Establish bUnit and the layered verification harness

[Master index](../../00_INDEX.md) · [Status rules](../../00_INDEX.md#status-rules) · [Original work-package order](../../reference/05_Execution_Coordination_and_Handover.md#section-6-1)

**Status scope:** NOT_STARTED means this new task has not been assessed/executed under this breakdown. It does not assert that its underlying code is absent. First inspect and reuse the current implementation. No current repository progress has been imported.

## Outcome

Prepare a reusable test lane without replacing existing tests or claiming unrun results.

**Original work package:** `R2R-01` — MediatR facade, async validation adapter, explicit DTO mapping, one transaction-owner registry, bUnit test project
**Original package exit:** One representative existing command/query migrated without behavior change or nested transaction.

## Before starting

Hard dependencies must be COMPLETED, with reviewed handoff evidence:

- [T005 — Implement asynchronous validation and explicit DTO mapping](005_Implement_asynchronous_validation_and_explicit_DTO_mapping.md)

**Shared file ownership:** the coordinator serializes migrations, DbContext snapshots, public DTOs and shared policy edits. A task owns only the requests listed below; consume other requests through their owner.

## Required reading

- [00 Scope and Evidence Boundaries](../../reference/00_Scope_and_Evidence_Boundaries.md)
- [03 Shared Domain Persistence CQRS Blazor](../../reference/03_Shared_Domain_Persistence_CQRS_Blazor.md)
- [04 Lifecycle Lineage and Module Ports](../../reference/04_Lifecycle_Lineage_and_Module_Ports.md)
- [06 Contract Clarifications and Resource Limits](../../reference/06_Contract_Clarifications_and_Resource_Limits.md)
- [01 Baseline Architecture and ADRs](../../reference/01_Baseline_Architecture_and_ADRs.md)

## Sequential work

1. Add the approved bUnit project/configuration compatible with existing .NET and xUnit packages.
2. Keep pure xUnit, real PostgreSQL integration, bUnit and real-host Playwright responsibilities distinct.
3. Create safe fixture setup and evidence conventions with exact commits, schema, roles, expected/observed values and commands.
4. Exercise the CQRS pilot and validation adapter through component tests; preserve current tests and their identities.

## 1. Domain Modeling (`.Domain`)

Use the source module’s aggregate/entity/value-object identities and lifecycle exactly where applicable. Classify each symbol as EXISTING, EXTEND, NEW or DECISION before editing. Preserve raw records, reviewed revisions and source-specific eligibility; do not introduce duplicate balances or reinterpret legacy state strings silently.

This foundation/coordination task changes only the shared contracts expressly described in its work steps. It does not independently create a new business aggregate.

## 2. Persistence & Migrations (`.Infrastructure`)

Implement only the persistence delta needed by this task. Locate existing mappings and transaction owners first. Preserve composite scope FKs, restrictive deletes, immutable history and revision concurrency; initial mapping extraction must show no model diff. Any new schema change uses the source’s proposed migration suffix convention with a real generated timestamp, prior-schema tests and a reviewed backfill/quarantine plan.

## 3. Application & CQRS Contracts (`.Application`)

No new public command/query is assigned to this task. Configure, verify or connect the contracts of the owning tasks. Any additional request name requires a recorded contract decision rather than an agent-generated assumption.

Full one-owner registry: [111 command/query contracts](../../coverage/01_Command_Query_Ownership.md).

## 4. Inter-Module Lineage & Boundaries

Use predecessor outputs by exact identity/revision/manifest, not by selecting a convenient latest row. Data handoff is through the owning application contracts, not copied mutable module state. New required set members must invalidate dependent current applicability; retain the historical decision and result.

**Required outputs:**

- Buildable component-test project and shared fixture/evidence conventions.
- Observed pilot tests and baseline suite results.

**Direct consumers unlocked by this task:**

- [T007 — Enforce reporting scope, current actor and shared identities](../02_Shared_Foundation/007_Enforce_reporting_scope_current_actor_and_shared_identities.md)

## 5. Blazor UI Architecture (`.Web`)

Extend the source-listed existing routes before adding a parallel workspace. Use immutable DTOs in per-circuit scoped UI state, separate EditContexts, EventCallbacks, server field errors and save/discard/cancel dirty guards. No circuit-owned DbContext, cross-user static state, optimistic approval or fake completion. Recheck selection tokens and clear protected content on route/scope loss.

## 6. Edge Cases, Security & Verification

**Required verification checks — not executed in this task pack:**

- Database invariants are not certified using EF InMemory.
- A test filename, count or AT identifier is not treated as executed acceptance.
- Fixture setup does not bypass the business action a browser test claims to exercise.

Use pure xUnit for deterministic rules, real PostgreSQL for persistence/concurrency, bUnit for component behavior and Playwright for actual Blazor journeys where applicable. Record the subset executed for this task. Deferred consumer tests stay explicitly unverified until their scheduled integration gate; a task completion is not automatic whole-module acceptance.

## Completion checklist

<!-- COMPLETION-CHECKLIST -->
- [ ] Current checkout, existing symbols and applicable approvals were inspected; scope conflicts are resolved or the task is BLOCKED.
- [ ] All hard dependencies are COMPLETED and their exact contracts/evidence were consumed.
- [ ] The task-specific work and every applicable invariant/owned request are implemented or proven already implemented; no placeholder outcome remains.
- [ ] Applicable migrations, validation, authorization, concurrency and source/history preservation checks have observed results.
- [ ] Required task-level tests pass with named expected/observed outcomes; future integration tests remain explicitly tracked instead of claimed complete.
- [ ] The independent reviewer accepted the exact reviewed commit and evidence; downstream owners received the handoff.

| Field | Value to record |
|---|---|
| Inspected baseline and reused symbols | Not recorded |
| Code commit / schema / deployed build if applicable | Not recorded |
| Requirement → assertion → command/run → observed result | Not recorded |
| Policy / scope approval reference | Not recorded |
| Known limitations / exact blocker | Not recorded |

**Tracking-only note:** filling these fields or running the status helper is not proof that tests ran, a professional approval, merge authorization or permission to perform a tenant operation.
